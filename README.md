A tool that helps make your conda environment files more lightweight by removing unnecessary transitive dependencies, leaving only whatâ€™s essential. 
It's a work-in-progress project, and we welcome feedback! 
Have ideas for new features or improvements? Open an issue in the repository to share your suggestions.

### How to use:
It is required to have conda installed. Once you are in a conda environment install conda `conda install conda` this is necessary for the package to work properly in the first place.
Then simply `pip install conda_dependency_cleaner`. You now can see all available operations if you type `cdc` into your console.

----
#### Clean Environment yaml files:
Once installed you can clean your `.yaml` or `.yml` files by running the command `cdc clean`. 
An example usage is as follows: 
```
cdc clean env.yml -nf env_cleaned.yml
```

For help and more info use `cdc clean --help`.

----
#### Convert pip dependencies to conda:
If you have a lot of pip dependencies which you want to convert to conda run `cdc convert`.
Note that this can be very slow if there is a lot of dependencies due to the underlying solver conda uses.
Sometimes the conversion fails, these failures will be reported after the script ran through.
```
cdc convert env.yml -nf env_converted.yml
```

For help and more info use `cdc clonvert --help`.
