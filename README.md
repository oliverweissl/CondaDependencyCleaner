### How to use:
It is required to have conda installed. Once you are in a conda environment install conda `conda install conda` this is necessary for the package to work properly in the first place.
Then simply `pip install conda_dependency_cleaner`. 

Once installed you can clean your `.yaml` or `.yml` files by running the command `clean-yaml`. 
An example usage is as follows: 
```
clean-yaml env.yml -nf env_cleaned.yml
```

For help and more info use `clean-yaml --help`.
